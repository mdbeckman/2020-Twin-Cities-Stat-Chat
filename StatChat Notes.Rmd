## What's all the excitement about?

- Data analysis is often collaborative. 
    - team contributing code to the same project, even same document
    - collaboration may be asynchronous 
    - an analyst may decide to continue work left behind by someone else.  
    - Each is simplified with VC or "source code management"

- version control records changes to a file or a set of files 
    - record the entire history/evolution a project;
    - manage contributions of multiple collaborators;
    - revisit history of the project 
    - revert back to a specific version of any file if needed;
    - draft changes without modifying the main file until you feel ready to commit to them. 

- Computational reproducibility 
    - accuracy of your code & methods 
    - allows others the opportunity to make use of your work 
        - replicate 
        - extend and modify for a new purpose. 
    - bolster integrity of the work 
    - preserve a complete and transparent record of all actions in a project from raw source data through final product. 

- Professional calibre workflow

## Steps for implementation as a learning objective

- First exposure to Git
- Configure RStudio & Git (trivial with RStudio Cloud)
- Deploying assignment Repos
    - student view
    - instructor view
    - individual & group assignments
- Assessment
