20. Configure GitHub Classroom Assignment
    - create concise assignment title
    - choose public vs private--should student work be visible to public, including other students?
    - determine whether students should have admin permissions on their repository, allowing them to
        - revoke instructor access
        - make private repo public
        - and more
    - enable assignment URL for easy distribution
    - you may initialize student repos with code, templates, data sets, etc 
        - imports contents of an existing GitHub Repo
        - can be a private repo associated with your own GitHub credentials
    - you can configure a due date in GitHub Classroom

21. Deploy assignment to students!
    - invitation link can be posted in LMS, or otherwise distributed.
    - when students click the link they will be prompted to accept the assignment
    - once accepted, the assignment "clones" a version of the starter code (if provided) and initiates a new repo for the student
    - student is then provided a link to their new GitHub repository (within your controlled github organization linked to the class)
